# Vue Music
A music server/player project I created to test the development experience of vue and compare it to react. It currently doesn't really serve any purpose beyond that and is neither finished nor polished. 

There are already many feature rich music servers out there like:
- [Navidrome](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome) 
- [Koel](https://github.com/koel/koel)
- [Airsonic](https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced)
